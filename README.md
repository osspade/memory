Memory is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down
on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. 
The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards using object-oriented PHP, 
to develop a basic 6 x 4 memory game with the assistance of Javascript's magic.
